#  Capitec SafePay :bank: 
A stealth emergency alert system disguised as a banking app that secretly helps GBV victims

Demo:https://ayandaluthuli.github.io/Capitec_SafePay/

Discreetly alerts trusted contacts when victims of gender-based violence (GBV) enter a secret PIN (0800). 
Designed for South African users where banking apps are common and rarely questioned.

#How it works 
Plausible Deniability
  - Fully functional "banking app" UI  
  - Hidden trigger only activates with PIN `0800`  

  Instant Location Sharing
  - Sends GPS coordinates via email (Formspree)  linked to my email 
  
 Safety First
  - No app installation needed (web-based)  
    
  Responsive Design
  - Works on all devices (feature phones to desktop)
